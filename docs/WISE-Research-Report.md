# Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs) in Europe and Ireland
## Comprehensive Research Report — February 2026

---

# PART 1: WISEs ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION

## 1. What Are WISEs?

Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs) are enterprises whose explicit objective is the social and professional integration of disadvantaged groups — people distanced from the labour market — through productive economic activity. They produce and sell goods or services, but their core mission is to integrate people into society and the world of work through employment, training, and participation.

**Target groups include:** long-term unemployed, persons with physical/mental/sensory disabilities, refugees and migrants, former prisoners, ex-addicts, early school leavers, Travellers, and other socially excluded populations.

ENSIE identifies three core pillars of WISEs:
1. **Social and professional integration** as the primary mission
2. **Positioning at the centre of the economic system** (real businesses producing real goods/services)
3. **Strong educational/pedagogical component** (structured support, training, and accompaniment)

### WISE Models

WISEs broadly fall into two fundamental types:

| Type | Description | Goal |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Type A: Transitional/Springboard** | Intermediate enterprises providing temporary work with training and coaching | Facilitate exit to the open labour market |
| **Type B: Permanent/Stable** | End employers providing stable, long-term jobs | Create permanent employment for those unable to access mainstream work |
| **Mixed Model** | Combination of both approaches | Serve diverse populations with varying needs |

Specific models include: transitional employment enterprises, social firms/cooperatives, sheltered workshops/adapted enterprises, intermediate labour market organisations, and training-through-work programmes.

## 10. Challenges Facing WISEs

### Funding Sustainability
- Heavy dependence on time-limited public subsidies
- Banks/private investors often reject WISEs due to unfamiliarity
- State aid complexity limits access to exemptions

### Scaling
- Inherently place-based; deep local relationships hard to replicate
- Tension between social mission and commercialisation at scale
- Ecosystem dependencies cannot easily be transplanted

### Impact Measurement
- Multi-dimensional outcomes unfolding over long timeframes
- No single agreed framework despite progress (Impact-WISEs, ESEM)
- Attribution challenges; cost of rigorous measurement

### Policy Gaps
- Uneven national legal frameworks (Italy has dedicated legislation; many don't)
- Fragmented policy responsibility across employment, social, enterprise, procurement
- Low uptake of socially responsible procurement despite EU directives
- Insufficient training for WISE managers and job coaches

### Structural Challenges
- Increasingly complex target groups with compounding disadvantages
- Digitalisation threatening traditional entry-level WISE activities
- COVID-19 aftermath: increased demand, reduced commercial revenues
- Workforce retention challenges in mission-driven organisations

# PART 2: WISEs IN IRELAND — COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

## 1. Irish WISE Landscape

### WISEs as the Dominant Model

Work Integration Social Enterprises are the **dominant model of social enterprise in Ireland**. Research by Patricia O'Hara (NUI Maynooth) and Mary O'Shaughnessy (UCC) demonstrates that successive Irish governments' adoption of a **labour market integration approach** since the early 1990s shaped one dominant social enterprise type: the WISE.

### No Dedicated Legal Form

Ireland has **no separate legal form** for social enterprise. WISEs operate under:
- Companies Limited by Guarantee (CLGs) — most common (75%)
- Charities (88% are registered charities)
- Designated Activity Companies (DACs)
- Cooperatives

### Scale

| Indicator | Figure |
|-----------|--------|
| Social enterprises in Ireland | 4,335 |
| People employed | 84,382 (3.7% of workforce) |
